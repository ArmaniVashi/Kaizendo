ABOUT

Kaizendo is about creating collaboratively authored polyscopic documents!

The goal is to create a web service that allows the management and creation
of texts that have "alternatives" each conveying the same message but in
different ways. E.g. a textbook chapter that is has alternatives written
for dyslectics and for fast readers.

To write such texts is a monumental task, and the Kaizendo project is about
making this not only feasible but as easy as possible.


STATUS

The project is still in the starting phase, and needs your help. If you're
