    content: 'It is not obvious for most people what contenxt youare referring to the expansive thinking of the late 1990s, this is especially true given that most readers of this book will not be from a technical background.'

      - author: Dick Harry
        content: Perhaps change the text so that effects of expansive thinking were present in the 1980s.
    content: 'The epansive thinking really started in the late 1980s, it was just later that the technology became available to implement many of the features. The lessons were learned before the turn of the millenium.'

    subject: These dates are wrong
  - author: Bob Builder
    content: "I thought it was normal to refer to 1900s, with only the decade and an apostrophe, like 90's. For dates after the millenium, I would assume you still keep the apostrophe, so it would be like 2000's. I am not a writer so correct me if I am wrong."
